    title: 'Why cutting back on junk food can feel like withdrawal',
    sentences: [
      'Junk-food lovers who try to cut back on fries or chocolate may experience symptoms similar to drug withdrawal, a new study suggests.',
      'Researchers found that people attempting to cut down on eating highly processed foods experience some of the same physical and psychological symptoms—such as mood swings, anxiety, headaches and poor sleep—as those quitting smoking cigarettes or using drugs, according to the study.',
      'The new study offers the first evidence that these withdrawal-like symptoms can occur when people cut down on highly processed foods, said lead study author Erica Schulte.',
      'Based on the participants’ self-reported symptoms, withdrawal symptoms were significantly more intense between the second and fifth days after attempting to reduce junk-food consumption, which parallels the time span people live through during drug withdrawal.',
      'The idea that food may be addictive after “heavy” use by some individuals is a controversial subject, Schulte said.',
      'Although prior studies in animals and humans have shown some biological and behavioral similarities between substance-use disorders and addictive-like consumption of highly processed foods, no studies have looked at whether reducing junk food can trigger withdrawal symptoms in people, she noted.',
      'Raising awareness that people may experience irritability (烦躁) or headaches when cutting down on junk food can help individuals prepare coping strategies in advance, Schulte noted.',
      'The findings may also shed light on the barriers people face when changing eating habits—barriers that may play a role in people dropping out of treatments, she said.',

        'Some researchers maintain that there is another type of disgust, called moral disgust, that protects us from engaging in activities that can be perceived as morally wrong.',
        'Examples of moral disgust are stealing, lying or cheating.',
        'However, not all academics think that moral disgust really exists.',
        'Some say that when we refer to disgust in relation to moral issues, we are using disgust as a metaphor (隐喻), and what we are feeling is in reality anger.',
